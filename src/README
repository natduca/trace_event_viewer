This code downloads the trace viewer code from the Chromium repository, starts
up a a local HTTP server that hosts that code, and then brings it up a WebKit
instance via either PyGtk or WxPython. The HTTP server then tricks the frontend
code into thinking that its running inside Chromium, giving you access to the
usual suite of trace viewing & analysis capabilities, less Chromium.

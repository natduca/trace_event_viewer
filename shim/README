This code glues the trace_viewer code from Chromium repository, which expects to
be running *inside chromium* into running standalone.

webkit_shim.js  fixes up old webkits to provide features
                that Chrome's code expects to see

chrome_shim.js  ties chrome.send to an AJAX to the
                FrontendDaemon so we can do things like
                load and save files while still leaving
                javascript mostly in charge..

index.*         Boots up the shim
